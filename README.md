## Files
- sources.txt -- useful links to more information, emulators, ROMs, etc.
- Bros.atr -- original game ROM. BROS is in the public domain.
- atari800-remap.ahk -- autohotkey script for more sane controls without a numpad on the atari800 emu
- convert-musik.py -- converts the datamined .DAT files into SPN music notes
- sheet.png, sheet.psd -- sprite sheet

## Folders
- cart/ -- PICO-8 cartridge.
- datamined/ -- MUSIK*.DAT files datamined from the original game
- manual/ -- images, transcription, and translation of the original game manual. German to english translation courtesy of Wbubbler

## License
Usually I put my stuff under GPL/CC BY-NC-SA, but public domain seems more in the spirit of things since the original game is in public domain, and PICO-8 with splore and stuff doesn't really handle licenses
